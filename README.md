### üëã Hi there
I'm Felipe Franco, a passionate product designer studying coding, cybersecurity, and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Product Designer at Ita√∫ (BRQ).
With over 15 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects, companies and explore different technologies.

### üöÄ Expertise
My primary focus in tech is on cybersecurity, where I'm focused on Linux and Networks. I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient in popular frameworks and libraries such as React, Node, and React Native.
I love working as a Product Designer because it allows me to combine my creativity with problem-solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences, but I love learning new things every day.
